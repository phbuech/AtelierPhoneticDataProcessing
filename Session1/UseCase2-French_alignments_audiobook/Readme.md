# Use Case 2: alignment of a French audiobook
In this tutorial we will align utterances from an audiobook. As an example, we will align some sentences from the LibriVox audiobook of "Le dernier jour d'un condamn√©" of Victor Hugo. The audiobook can be found [here](https://librivox.org/le-dernier-jour-by-victor-hugo/) and the corresponding text [here](https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Dernier_Jour_d%E2%80%99un_Condamn%C3%A9/01). The files folder contains an excerpt of the data including audio and transcriptions, as well as the TextGrid output of the alignment process.
