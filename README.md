# Atelier Phonetic Data Processing
This repository contains the materials for the Workshop "Phonetic Data Processing". In this workshop, we get familiar with forced alignment using the [Montreal Forced Aligner](https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/Montreal-Forced-Aligner) (for the documentation, click [here](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), as well as processing of data collected via Electromagnetic Articulography ([EMA](https://www.journal-labphon.org/article/id/6289/)).
